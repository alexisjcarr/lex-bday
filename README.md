## Event Details

Hey everyone!

I'm excited to invite you all to my birthday celebration next week! We'll be gathering at Emmy Squared Pizza, to enjoy some delicious pizza (gluten-friendly if you have issues like me) and great company.

After dinner, we can walk over to Regal Green Hills for a screening of [Longlegs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG7wOTE8NhE). I can't wait to celebrate with all of you!

Yes, I'm aware that using GitHub for this is ridiculous, but I said it as a joke, and then wanted to try it ðŸ˜‚ In the future, I'm gonna automate some of the tasks (like using Actions to take RSVPs to update the guest list and sending out invitations) just to dogfood GitHub a little for fun.
